                            <h4>The Problem</h4>
                            <p>A growing real estate firm was struggling with their CRM's limitations - it lacked native texting capabilities, forcing agents to switch between multiple apps to communicate with clients. This led to missed messages, delayed responses, and no centralized record of client communications. There is not an option to move to a different CRM with native texting capabilities.</p>

                        <div class="solution">
                            <h4>The Solution</h4>
                            <p>We developed a custom integration that connected their CRM with a messaging API, enabling agents to send and receive texts directly within their CRM interface. The solution included automated message logging, contact synchronization, and template-based responses. This resulted in 40% faster response times and complete communication records for every client interaction.</p>

                            <p>A construction company was manually tracking vendor purchase orders and invoices bi-weekly, causing payment delays and confusion about which trade partners had completed their work. The process was time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to strained relationships with subcontractors.</p>

                            <p>We implemented an automated system that tracks POs, completion status, and invoices in real-time inside of their existing software - preventing a costly and timely migration. The solution includes automated status updates, payment scheduling, and a dashboard for tracking payment cycles. This reduced payment processing time by 75% and improved vendor satisfaction scores by 60%.</p>

                            <p>A financial advisory firm spent hours manually preparing, documenting, and distributing consultation materials for each client meeting. Advisors were losing valuable time on administrative tasks instead of focusing on client relationships.</p>

                            <p>We created an automated workflow system that handles pre-meeting preparation, records consultations, and generates comprehensive post-meeting documentation. The system automatically compiles assessment notes, recordings, and action items into a client-ready format. This automation saved advisors 15 hours per week and improved client documentation quality by 90%.</p>

                            <p>A chain of hair salons with five locations was losing clients due to their manual booking process. Staff spent 3 hours daily calling clients for confirmations and managing a paper waitlist. Last-minute cancellations weren't being filled, and clients were frustrated with phone-only booking. Their current booking software didn't support automated notifications or online scheduling.</p>

                        <div class="solution">

                            <p>We built an automation layer on top of their existing booking system that enables online scheduling, automated SMS/email confirmations, and a digital waitlist system. When cancellations occur, the system automatically contacts waitlisted clients in order of priority. This solution saved 15 hours of staff time per week across locations, reduced empty slots by 40%, and increased customer satisfaction ratings by 50%.</p>

                            <p>We implemented an automated inventory management system that monitors stock levels in real-time, predicts demand using historical data, and automatically generates purchase orders.
